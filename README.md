# Employee Directory



## Summary

The Employee Directory is a React based app that pulls in data for 12 users from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) and displays their name, email and cell phone number in a sortable table.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
